  - What assets do you have? What assets did the company come with? Patented data mining system
  - "Our patented software prevents any company from drilling into the database to a point where they could isolate the market position of any other specific contributing company. Reports and analytics never list data by individual company."
  - Whats the vision for this company this year and 5 years from now?
  - "Retego Data is now poised to be able to expand into markets outside of insurance using their same technical insight but without the connection to their insurance-focused application"
  - Do you also do user case studies / feedback? 
  - "Simple annual fee - no per user fees" Have you used price elasticity to back this decision up? User training included?
